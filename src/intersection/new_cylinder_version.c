1-- set rotation angles to go from world space to object space;
2-- set translation to go from one frame to another
3-- transform the important points
4-- do the resolution of the cylinder line intersection
5-- find the small distance
6-- reproject back douk les disances aka from object space to world space


-----------------
1-- what are the parametric points aka the most important ones?
- r_or, r_dial_la_fin_dial_orientation, center_cylinder, orientation dial_cylinder
2-- constitute the transformation matrix to go from world to object aka trs, s = 0, r = angles dial l'object / ongles dial world, t = center de l'objet / center dial l'object'
3--
